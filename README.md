###Sublime Text 2

Grab the theme file and put it in `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Color Scheme - Default/`

or...

```
cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Color Scheme - Default/
git clone git clone git@github.com:andrewfiorillo/Cupid.git
```

This will put the theme in its own directory in your themes directory. This way you can just `git pull` to get theme updates.


###Textmate
